# boilerplate-web-template

This template is designed to allow web-development to jump straight into learning the basics without the 
intimidation that comes with setting up a development environment

## Dependencies (Have these already installed on your computer)
- node.js
- npm
- git

 
## How to Use this Template

### `npm run start`

- This command will start the development server
- http://localhost:3000 will be used by default (can be overridden using environment variables)
- Upon saving any file inside of the `public/` directory, nodemon will reinstantiate the server as well as refresh the browser
so you can see your changes immediately
  - *NOTE*: nodemon is configured by default to only watch for changes on files with `.js`, `.html`, and `.css` file extentions
